# HR-Attrition-Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates employee attrition using the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset. The objective is to explore factors that contribute to employees leaving the company and present key findings through a dynamic Power BI dashboard.

Using a combination of **SQL** and **Power BI**, this analysis identifies patterns related to job satisfaction, department, overtime, income, and more—insights that can help HR teams improve retention strategies.


## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- **Power BI**: Data modeling and interactive dashboard creation
- **CSV Dataset**: [IBM HR Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
